Identify digits from a MNIST dataset - Kaggle competition

This Kaggle competition project includes: Deep Learning, Convolution Classifier, Convolution Classifier with Batch Normalization and Dropout to improve training and Custom Convnets. I also used Perceptron but finally I commented it because it was to slow. I used softmax method to assess score and Adam optimizer to compile models (based on models scores). I attach links to sources which was really helpful to solving my problems and I really appreciate and thankful for authors of these solutions, methods.
